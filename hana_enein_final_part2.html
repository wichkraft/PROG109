<h3>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</h3>
I had no knowledge of HTML or CSS before taking this class. <br>
I didn't technically know JavaScript either, but I did know how to code with java, <br>
and the execution is pretty much the same.

<h3>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</h3>
I used a template, the same one from the Module 4 assignment.

<h3>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)</h3>
The most challenging part of my portfolio was mastering my relative pathways. <br>
It was a concept I'd been confused about to begin with but getting my navigation bar links to <br>
work and all my images to load correctly required I get good at them. 

<h3>How taking this class changed your view on Web Development?</h3>
This class helped me realize just how dynamic web development is. Nothing about <br> 
the mechanics of HTML/CSS/JS specifically surprised me, but what really stood out was just how <br>
many possible ways there was to go about solving the same problem. The other thing I mean by the word <br>
"dynamic" is how fast-changing the web development field is, with web browsers and HTML standards being constanly updated. <br>
It became apparent to me throughout this course that web development wasn't a "one-and-done" type thing, and that having 
a professional-looking website was something that required constant updating.

<h3>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</h3>
This may be obvious, but defintely to not leave assignments to the last minute like I often did. The first week especially, <br>
as that is where I found I had the steepest learning curve and assignments were taking me way longer than anticipated. <br> My
other peice of advice would be to get VScode. I found that it really streamlined the process and helped me be more efficient (but <br>
thats just a personal preferance).
