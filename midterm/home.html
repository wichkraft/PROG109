                    This is a website showcaasing the work created in my Web Developement class (PROG109).
                    Some pages also share a little about myself. Here's a more detailed account of some of the stuff 
                    you can find on my website: A page showing the course I took, pages showing the module 
                    assignments and artifacts created throughout the course, as well as a creative page that shares
                    some stuff about me and my interests. There's also a Contact Me page, for anyone that would like 
                    to send a message. 

                    I created this profolio as a way to showcase and be able to go back to everything I did in my
                    PROG109 class. This was created Spring of 2023, feel free to check it out!
